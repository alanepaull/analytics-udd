## Description of course_subject entity
A course_subject describes the subject or subjects of study of a course, using a specified subject classification system.

## Notes
The design of the course_subject entity follows the design of HESA's Data Futures logical model.

## COURSE_SUBJECT_ID
### Description
Primary key. Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

### Purpose
Unique identifier for the entity

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

## SUBJECT_ID
### Description
Code for subject of study

### Purpose
For display and analytical purposes

### Derivation

### Valid Values
[JACS3 CSV](../media/jacs3-valid-entries.csv)
[HECOS CSV](../media/HECoS-Vocabulary.csv)

### Format
String (10) - JACS: 4 characters, number followed by three digits; HECoS: 6 digits

### Notes
In relation to any 1 course, an institution must supply subject of study data using only 1 classification system. Typically this will be either JACS3 or, in the future, HECoS. 
Omitting this property could impair the functionality of analytics applications such as student apps or dashboards.

## SUBJECT_LABEL
### Description
Human readable name for the subject of study

### Purpose
For display purposes

### Format

## ENCODING_ID
### Description
Prescribed name of the subject of study classification system used in SUBJECT_ID

### Purpose
To indicate the subject of study classification system used.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Additional encoding schemes may be added to Valid Values in the future.

## PROPORTION
### Description
For combined courses only, this property shows the weighting of the subject of study as a percentage of the study load. For a balanced combined course, this value will be 50.

### Purpose
For display and analytical purposes

### Derivation
HESA Data Futures, https://www.hesa.ac.uk/files/Collection%20Design%20Logical%20Model.pdf

### Valid Values
0-100

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
The value represents a percentage.
This property applies only to combined courses and should not be used for integrated courses, or those commonly described as "single subject" courses, even if more than 1 subject of study code is needed to describe subject content of the course.
This property was historically referred to in HESA documentation as "weighting".

## SEQUENCE_ID
### Description
Where there is more than 1 course_subject record for a course, this property indicates the order of importance of each subject. More important subjects have lower numbers; for example, the subject with value "1" is the most important.

### Purpose
For display and analytical purposes

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Positive integer

### Format
Integer

### Notes
Typically used where a combined course has roughly balanced subjects, or where it was necessary to use more than 1 subject of study to describe a non-combined course adequately.
