## Description of staff_link entity
A staff_link record relates a member of staff to any other entity in the UDD. A staff_link specifies that there is a relationship between the member of staff and the concrete entity referenced by REF_KEY. The type of relationship is described in the RELATIONSHIP property, but the meaning of the relationship, and any functionality associated with it, is not prescribed in the UDD. Instead these are defined and controlled by the organisation responsible for a particular product or service, and are further identified by the RELATIONSHIP_NAMESPACE. 

The combination of RELATIONSHIP and RELATIONSHIP_NAMESPACE enables the owning organisation to define the meaning of the RELATIONSHIP and to limit any functionality that it provides to its own products and services. Other organisations MAY use these RELATIONSHIPs, but no system behaviour should be inferred, except when using one of their own namespaced RELATIONSHIPs.
