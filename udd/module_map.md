## Description
The module_map entity establishes an association between a module_instance and relevant information in another system. This association may be relatively fuzzy, in that the concepts on each side of the relationship may be different. However, the mapping might be used where the two IDs are in fact identical and relate to information about a single module.

A module_map links a module instance from a student record system with relevant information from another system specified by MODULE_MAP_DOMAIN, typically a VLE or timetable system. The associated identifier in the other system is contained in DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID.

By default, MOD_INSTANCE_ID and DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID form a uniqueness constraint within the specified MODULE_MAP_DOMAIN. For example, where the MODULE_MAP_DOMAIN is 'VLE', then MOD_INSTANCE_ID and DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID form a uniqueness constraint, so that each module instance in the UDD can have more than one reference in the VLE and vice versa; this might be relevant where the VLE contains references to different components of the same module with no over-arching VLE module record, or the VLE has material that relates directly to more than one module in the student record system.

## MODULE_MAP_ID
### Description
Primary key. Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the Learning Data Hub loading mechanism.

### Purpose
Enables easy reference to the map between module instance and the other system.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Primary key. Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the Learning Data Hub loading mechanism.

## MODULE_MAP_DOMAIN

### Description
Identifies the system within which DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID exists, typically a VLE or timetable system.

### Purpose
Efficient processing of IDs, and lookup of data in xAPI statements.

### Valid values
Values should be one of the following:

- 'VLE' - this is a reserved label for the institution's primary VLE.

- a local name that identifies the system within which DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID exists, for example 'Scientia'.

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Local name values are not maintained in the UDD.

## DOMAIN_MAPPED_ID

### Description
An identifier for an area in the system identified by MODULE_MAP_DOMAIN that is associated in some way with the module identified by MOD_INSTANCE_ID. 

### Purpose
Display in apps and dashboards

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid values
Any

### Format
String (255)
