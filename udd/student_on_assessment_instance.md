## Description of student_on_assessment_instance entity
A student_on_assessment_instance describes a student's performance on a specific assessment.

## STUDENT_ON_ASSESSMENT_INSTANCE_ID
### Description
Primary key. Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

### Purpose
Enables easy reference to student_on_assessment_instance.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Format
String(255)

### Notes
Where not supplied by data provider, the primary key will be generated by the LRW loading mechanism.

## ASSESS_SEQ_ID
### Description.
A unique sequence number to indicate the order of opportunities afforded to a student against the assessment indicated by assess_instance_id.  These opportunities might be referred to as "attempts" at an assessment, but should include all opportunities, even if the attempt was not in fact made, owing to illness for example.

### Purpose
To identify the latest assessment attempt by a student, regardless of whether or not results were achieved, especially for those being reassessed. Each assessment attempt should have a unique student_on_assessment_instance record, regardless of mitigating circumstances or results.

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
Integer

### Notes
The ASSESS_SEQ_ID number should be incremented in line with the chronological order of assessment opportunities afforded to the student in respect of the specified assessment.
The first attempt or assessment opportunity would have ASSESS_SEQ_ID = 1.
This property relates to the number of times a student has taken, or had the opportunity to take, an assessment, not the sequence of all the assessments on a module.

## ASSESS_DUE_DATE
### Description.
The date an assessment instance for a student was due for submission.

### Purpose
Analytics and display

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Date in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Format
String in ISO 8601 Date extended format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Notes


## ASSESS_RETAKE
### Description.
States whether this is a retake of the assessment for that student as a result of mitigating circumstances.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
<table>
<tr><td>ASSESS_RETAKE</td><td>DESCRIPTION(ENGLISH)</td><td>DESCRIPTION(WELSH)  </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Yes</td><td>Ie  </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>No</td><td>Na</td></tr>
</table>  

### Format
String (255)

### Notes


## ASSESS_ACTUAL_MARK
### Description.
The mark awarded to the learner after any moderation process, but before any formal confirmation process. Moderation processes typically involve multiple markers, and confirmation processes typically involve external examiners.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
0-100

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
ASSESS_ACTUAL_MARK should only be part of a UDD compliant dataset if there is a moderation process and if the result of that process is available in the source data. 


## ASSESS_AGREED_MARK
### Description.
The mark recorded after any moderation or confirmation processes, or the only recorded mark if there are no moderation or confirmation processes.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
0-100

### Format
Decimal

### Notes
ASSESS_AGREED_MARK is expected to be present in any UDD compliant dataset as soon as it becomes available.


## ASSESS_ACTUAL_GRADE
### Description.
The grade awarded to the learner after any moderation process, but before any formal confirmation process. Moderation processes typically involve multiple markers, and confirmation processes typically involve external examiners.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
ASSESS_ACTUAL_GRADE should only be part of a UDD compliant dataset if there is a moderation process and if the result of that process is available in the source data.


## ASSESS_AGREED_GRADE
### Description.
The grade recorded after any moderation or confirmation processes, or the only recorded grade if there are no moderation or confirmation processes. 

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
ASSESS_AGREED_GRADE is expected to be present in any UDD compliant dataset as soon as it becomes available.


## ASSESSMENT_CURRENT_ATTEMPT
### Description.
Number of attempts taken by a student so far on an assessment instance, that are recognised by the institution as separate attempts.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
Integer

### Notes
Some institutions' regulations permit attempts with mitigating circumstances to be ignored as attempts, for example where a second attempt might otherwise limit the maximum mark available.
Omitting this property may hinder the development or use of an effective analytics model.

## ASSESSMENT_RESULT
### Description.
Indicates whether the student passed the assessment, didn't pass the assessment, deferred the assessment or whether this information is not known because the assessment hasn't been due yet.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc; student_on_a_module_instance.MOD_RESULT

<table>
<tr><td>ASSESSMENT_RESULT</td><td>DESCRIPTION(ENGLISH)</td><td>DESCRIPTION(WELSH)  </td></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Pass</td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Fail</td><td>  </td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Not known</td><td> </td></tr>
</table>  

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
Code 3 is applied in all cases where the outcome is either not known (yet), or doesn't apply because the student hasn't been assessed yet. 
Omitting this property could impair the functionality of analytics applications such as student apps or dashboards.


## GRADE_DATE
### Description.
The date at which the grade result has been confirmed and awarded.

### Purpose
Analytics

### Derivation
Jisc

### Valid Values
Date in ISO 8601 format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Format
String in ISO 8601 Date extended format - YYYY-MM-DD

### Notes
This is the date when a grade has been moderated and agreed, but before exam board confirmation. It is typically the date at which the grade is entered in a SRS.


## X_ASSESS_DETAIL
### Description.
An extra implementation optimisation that isn't part of the UDD model. It's value is identical to that of the relevant assessment_instance.ASSESS_DETAIL.

### Purpose
Implementation optimisation

### Derivation
Jisc; assessment_instance.ASSESS_DETAIL

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
This data is generated internally from existing data, and does not need to be supplied by an institution.


## X_MOD_ID
### Description.
An extra implementation optimisation that isn't part of the UDD model. Its value is identical to that of the relevant module.MOD_ID.

### Purpose
Implementation optimisation

### Derivation
Jisc; module.MOD_ID

### Valid Values
Any

### Format
String (255)

### Notes
This data is generated internally from existing data, and does not need to be supplied by an institution.
